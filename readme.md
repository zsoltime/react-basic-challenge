# 3 Weeks React Basic Challenge

The idea was to create simple throw-away ReactJS apps in ~~the next 3 weeks~~ this February, learn ReactJS thoroughly and come up with 3-4 real apps.

Even if the projects themselves are not useful, the skills I can gain from working on them are.

> It's really difficult for me to put anything but perfect online and it hasn't changed since my [3 weeks game challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge) in last December. Typing `git push` at the end of the day and making my code visible on a public repo still makes me feel bad :D The real challenge is not writing code but showing them to everyone.

Here is a list of the apps I'll create in the next 3-4 weeks. It may change a bit :)
