# 3 Weeks React Basic Challenge

The idea was to create simple throw-away ReactJS apps in ~~the next 3 weeks~~ this February, learn ReactJS thoroughly and come up with 3-4 real apps.

Even if the projects themselves are not useful, the skills I can gain from working on them are.

> It's really difficult for me to put anything but perfect online and it hasn't changed since my [3 weeks game challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge) in last December. Typing `git push` at the end of the day and making my code visible on a public repo still makes me feel bad :D

Here is a list of the apps I'll create in the next 3-4 weeks. It will change a bit :)

- React Gallery
- React Leaderboard
- React Timer
- React Markdown Editor
- React Giphy Search
- React Countdown
- React Contact List
- React Loan Calculator
- React Weather App
- React Typing Game
- React Tic Tac Toe
- React Hangman
- React Book Listing
