# React Basic Challenge

The idea was to create simple throw-away ReactJS apps in ~~the next 3 weeks~~ this February, learn ReactJS thoroughly and come up with 3-4 real apps.

Even if the apps/projects themselves are not useful, the skills I can gain from working on them are.

> It's really difficult for me to put anything but perfect online and it hasn't changed since my [3 weeks game challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge) in last December. The repos below are far from perfect so typing `git push` at the end of the day and making my code visible on a public repo still made me feel bad ðŸ˜£ The real challenge is not writing code but showing them to everyone. ðŸ˜‡
